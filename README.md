# My Personal Website
Personal website project created for my Website Design 2 class at Columbia College Chicago.

The files currently available are from my first project, which was to create a website for a real or fictional business/organization. I chose a local coffee shop called Iconic Coffee Shop for my project. The website includes working Home, About, and Menu pages with a mobile-friendly layout.
