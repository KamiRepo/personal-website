              <p>Iconic Coffee Shop first opened its doors at the Riverside Plaza Building in late August 2022. The owner Laura Intrain has a scientific background that brings precision to her coffee-brewing and culinary skills. For many years, Intrain worked as a microbiologist at a laboratory, performing tests on food in order to meet U.S. Department of Agriculture standards. However, the lure of serving customers in restaurants and coffee shops proved greater than working in a laboratory.</p>

              <p>Iconic features not only coffee drinks but teas, yogurt parfaits, and a plethora of pastries that Intrain bakes herself. This includes scones, croissants, cookies, muffins, banana bread, pumpkin bread and other baked goods. "There is always at least one item from the oven for vegans," Intrain said; other specialties include avocado toast and oatmeal. She also creates her own flavored syrups, such as pumpkin spice for the espresso drinks.</p>

              <p>This high-profile location in the heart of the historic downtown business district has attracted a loyal following of patrons seeking a latte, an espresso or just a cuppa joe. While Intrain says that preparing drinks her customers will like is paramount, providing good customer service is the key to keep people coming back.</p>
